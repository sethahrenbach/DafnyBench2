error_results/codellama-7b__outputs/518_dafny-synthesis_task_id_249_no_hints.dfy(1,2): Error: this symbol not expected in Dafny

1 |   I apologize for the mistake in my previous response. Based on the Dafny feedback, it seems that the issue is with the syntax of the code. The error message suggests that the code is not well-formed and there is a parse error.
