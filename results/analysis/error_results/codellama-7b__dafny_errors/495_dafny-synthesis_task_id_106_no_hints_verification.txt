error_results/codellama-7b__outputs/495_dafny-synthesis_task_id_106_no_hints.dfy(1,2): Error: this symbol not expected in Dafny

1 |   I apologize for the confusion. The error message you received is due to a syntax error in the Dafny code. The `this symbol not expected in Dafny` message indicates that the parser found a symbol that is not allowed in the current context.
