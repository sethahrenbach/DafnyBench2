  I apologize for the confusion, and I'll be happy to help you with your Dafny code. Can you please provide the code you're trying to verify, and the Dafny feedback you're receiving? This will help me understand the issue and provide a more accurate solution.

Also, please keep in mind that the preconditions and postconditions of the original program must be maintained, as they are part of the requirements of the test.
