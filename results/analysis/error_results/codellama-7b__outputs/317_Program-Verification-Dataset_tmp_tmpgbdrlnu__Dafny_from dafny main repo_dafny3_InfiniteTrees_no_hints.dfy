This program is correct. The Dafny verifier was able to prove the postcondition for the function.

The error message you received is indicating that the parser was unable to parse the input text correctly. It is not related to the correctness of the program, but rather an issue with the input text.

In this case, the error message is indicating that the input text contains an invalid symbol, which is not expected in the context of the program. It is possible that the input text contains a typo or a mistake in the syntax, and the parser was unable to recover from it.

To fix the error, you can try to carefully review the input text and make sure it is correct and matches the syntax of the program. If you are still unable to fix the error, you can try to provide more information about the input text, such as the context in which it is being used, or any other relevant details that may help to identify the issue.
