  I apologize for the previous errors. It seems that the issue is with the syntax of the code. The error message suggests that the code is not well-formed, and there is a parse error.

Here is the corrected code:

method CalDiv() returns (x:int, y:int)
  ensures x==191/7
  ensures y==191%7
{
  x, y := 0, 191;
  while 7 <= y
  {
    // Loop Invariant: x is the number of iterations so far
    // and y is the remainder of 191 divided by 7
    assert x <= 25 && y == 191%7;

    x := x+1;
    y:=191-7*x;

    // Postcondition: x is the number of iterations so far
    // and y is the remainder of 191 divided by 7
    assert x <= 25 && y == 191%7;
  }
  // Postcondition: x is the number of iterations so far
  // and y is the remainder of 191 divided by 7
  assert x <= 25 && y == 191%7;
}
