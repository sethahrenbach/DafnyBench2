  I apologize for the mistake. Here is the corrected version of the code:

method mod2(n: nat) returns (a: nat)
  ensures a == f2(n)
{
  var x: nat := 1;
  var y: nat := 0;
  var k: nat := n;
  while k > 0
  {
    y := x * (k % 4) + y;
    x := 5 * x;
    k := k / 3;
  }
  a := y;
}

I hope this corrected version of the code passes the Dafny verification.
