  I apologize for the confusion. It seems that the previous code had a syntax error. Here is a corrected version of the code:

method BubbleSort(A:array<int>)
    modifies A
    ensures sorted(A)
    ensures multiset(A[..]) == multiset(old(A[..]))
{
    var N := A.Length;
    var i := N-1;
    while 0 < i
    {
        // Loop invariant: A[..] is sorted between 0 and i-1
        assert sorted_between(A, 0, i-1);

        var j := 0;
        while j < i
        {
            // Loop invariant: A[..] is sorted between 0 and i-1
            assert sorted_between(A, 0, i-1);

            if A[j] > A[j+1]
            {
                A[j], A[j+1] := A[j+1], A[j];
                // Loop invariant: A[..] is sorted between 0 and i-1
                assert sorted_between(A, 0, i-1);
            }
            j := j+1;
        } 
        i := i-1;
        // Loop invariant: A[..] is sorted between 0 and i-1
        assert sorted_between(A, 0, i-1);
    }
}

I hope this corrected code meets your requirements.
