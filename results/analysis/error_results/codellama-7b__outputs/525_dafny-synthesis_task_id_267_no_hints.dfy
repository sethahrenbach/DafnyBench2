  I apologize for the mistake in my previous answer. Here is the corrected code with the Dafny feedback taken into account:

method SumOfSquaresOfFirstNOddNumbers(n: int) returns (sum: int)
    requires n >= 0
    ensures sum == (n * (2 * n - 1) * (2 * n + 1)) / 3
{
    // Loop invariant: sum is the sum of the squares of the first k odd numbers
    loop invariant 0 <= k <= n ==> sum == (k * (2 * k - 1) * (2 * k + 1)) / 3;

    // Precondition: n is a non-negative integer
    assert n >= 0;

    // Postcondition: sum is the sum of the squares of the first n odd numbers
    assert sum == (n * (2 * n - 1) * (2 * n + 1)) / 3;

    sum := 0;
    var i := 1;
    for k:=0 to n
    {
        sum := sum + i * i;
        i := i + 2;
    }
}
