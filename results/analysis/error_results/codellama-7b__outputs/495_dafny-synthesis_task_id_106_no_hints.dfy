  I apologize for the confusion. The error message you received is due to a syntax error in the Dafny code. The `this symbol not expected in Dafny` message indicates that the parser found a symbol that is not allowed in the current context.

To fix the error, you can try the following:

1. Check the syntax of the symbol in your code. Make sure that it is correctly formatted and that there are no typos or other errors.
2. If you are using a specific Dafny library or framework, make sure that you are using the correct version and that you have properly configured it.
3. If you are still having trouble, try running the Dafny verifier with the `--verbose` flag to get more detailed error messages. This may help you identify the specific part of your code that is causing the error.

I hope this helps. Let me know if you have any other questions.
