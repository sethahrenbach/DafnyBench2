  I apologize for the previous errors. It seems that the error message is indicating that the code is not well-formed and contains a parse error. Here is the corrected code:

method main(x: int, y: int) returns (x_out: int, y_out: int, n: int)
requires x >= 0
requires y >= 0
requires x == y
ensures y_out == n
{
    x_out := x;
    y_out := y;
    n := 0;

    while (x_out != n)
    {
        // Loop invariant: x_out - 1 == n
        assert x_out - 1 == n;

        x_out := x_out - 1;
        y_out := y_out - 1;

        // Postcondition: y_out == n
        assert y_out == n;
    }

    // Additional postcondition: x_out == n
    assert x_out == n;
}

I hope this corrected code passes the Dafny verification.
