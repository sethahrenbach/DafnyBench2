  I apologize for the confusion. It seems that the code you provided is not valid Dafny code. Can you please provide a valid Dafny program that I can use to test the verification?

Also, please note that the preconditions and postconditions of the original program should be kept the same in the modified program, as they are part of the contract that the function is expected to uphold.
