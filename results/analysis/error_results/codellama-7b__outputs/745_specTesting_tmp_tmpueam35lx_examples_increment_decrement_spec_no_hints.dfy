  I apologize for the confusion. It seems that the error message you received is not related to the code you provided.

To fix the error, you can try the following:

1. Check the syntax of the code you provided to make sure it is correct.
2. Make sure that the code is properly indented and that there are no missing or extra curly braces.
3. Check that the code is not trying to access a variable or function that does not exist.
4. If you are using a library or framework, make sure that you have included the necessary imports and that the library is properly configured.
5. If you are still having trouble, you can try using a different programming language or framework to see if the issue persists.

I hope this helps. If you have any further questions or concerns, please let me know.

As for the preconditions and postconditions, they should be the same as the original program. If you have any questions about the preconditions and postconditions, please let me know and I will do my best to assist you.
