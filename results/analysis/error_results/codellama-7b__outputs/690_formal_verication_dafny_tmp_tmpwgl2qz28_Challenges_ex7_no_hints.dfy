  I apologize for the mistake in my previous response. Here is the corrected code with the Dafny feedback taken into account:

type Bases = {C, A, G, T};

method Sorter(bases: seq<Bases>) returns (sobases:seq<Bases>)
  requires 0 < |bases|
  ensures |sobases| == |bases|
  ensures bordered(sobases)
  ensures multiset(bases) == multiset(sobases)
{
  var c, next:nat := 0, 0;
  var g, t:nat := |bases|, |bases|;

  while next != g
  {
    match(bases[next]) {
      case C => next := next + 1;
      case A => bases := Exchanger(bases, next, c);
        c, next := c + 1, next + 1;
      case G => bases := Exchanger(bases, next, g);
        g := g - 1;
      case T => bases := Exchanger(bases, next, t);
        t := t - 1;
        if (g != t) {bases := Exchanger(bases, next, g);}
    }
  }

  return bases;
}

The error message you received is due to the fact that the `Bases` type was not declared in the scope of the `Sorter` method. To fix this, we need to declare the `Bases` type in the scope of the `Sorter` method.

With this corrected code, the Dafny verifier should be able to verify the correctness of the `Sorter` method.
