  I apologize for the mistake in my previous response. Here is the corrected code with the Dafny feedback taken into account:

ghost function f(n: nat): nat {
    if n == 0 then 1 
    else if n%2 == 0 then 1 + 2*f(n/2)
    else 2*f(n/2)
}

method mod(n:nat) returns (a:nat) 
ensures a == f(n)
{
    var x:nat := 0;
    var y:nat := 1;
    var k:nat := n;
    while k > 0
    {
        if (k%2 == 0) {
            x := x + y;
        } else {
        }
        y := 2*y;
        k := k/2;
    }
    a := x+y;
}

The error message "this symbol not expected in Dafny" indicates that the verifier encountered an unexpected symbol in the code. In this case, the symbol "invalid something" is typically the name of an internal parser non-terminal that was being parsed. This suggests that the text being parsed is a badly malformed instance of whatever parser entity was being parsed.

The feedback from the verifier also suggests that the file contains no code, which can be because the file is empty, because some parse error left the top-level module with no well-formed declarations, or because a unclosed comment has commented-out the whole file.

To fix the issue, you can try to carefully scrutinize the location of the error to see what might be wrong with the text. If you think this is a common or confusing enough occurrence to warrant special error handling, please suggest the improvement, with this sample code, to the Dafny team.
