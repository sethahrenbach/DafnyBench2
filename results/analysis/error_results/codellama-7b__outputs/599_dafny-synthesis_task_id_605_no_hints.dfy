  I apologize for the previous errors. Here is the corrected code:

method IsPrime(n: int) returns (result: bool)
    requires n >= 2
    ensures result <==> (forall k :: 2 <= k < n ==> n % k != 0)
{
    result := true;
    var i := 2;
    while i <= n/2
    {
        // Loop Invariant: n % i != 0
        assert n % i != 0;
        if n % i == 0
        {
            result := false;
            break;
        }
        i := i + 1;
    }
    // Postcondition: result <==> (forall k :: 2 <= k < n ==> n % k != 0)
    assert result <==> (forall k :: 2 <= k < n ==> n % k != 0);
    // Assertion: (forall k :: 2 <= k < n ==> n % k != 0)
    assert (forall k :: 2 <= k < n ==> n % k != 0);
}

The corrected code includes the assertion for the postcondition and the assertion for the loop invariant. The assertion for the postcondition is added to ensure that the result is true if and only if the loop invariant holds. The assertion for the loop invariant is added to ensure that the loop invariant is true for all values of i.

I apologize for any confusion caused by the previous errors.
