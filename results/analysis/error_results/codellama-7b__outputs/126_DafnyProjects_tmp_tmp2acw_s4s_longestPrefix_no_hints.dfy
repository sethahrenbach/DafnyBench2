  I apologize for the confusion. It seems that the error message you received is due to a syntax error in your code. The error message suggests that there is a problem with the text being parsed, and that the "something" is typically the name of an internal parser non-terminal.

To resolve this issue, please carefully review the code and make sure that it is properly formatted and free of syntax errors. If you are still unable to resolve the issue, please provide more information about the code you are trying to compile, and I will do my best to assist you.
