  I apologize for the confusion. It seems that there was an error in the code that prevented it from being verified. The error message indicates that there is a problem with the syntax of the code.

To fix this issue, you can try rewriting the code to make sure that it is structured correctly and that it is using the parser correctly. You can also try using a different parser or a different programming language to see if the issue is specific to the current parser or if it is a more general issue with the code.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any questions or need further assistance.
