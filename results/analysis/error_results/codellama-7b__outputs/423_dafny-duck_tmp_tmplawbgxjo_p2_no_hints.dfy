  I apologize for the mistake in my previous answer. Here is the corrected code with the Dafny feedback taken into account:

function abs(x:int):nat {
  if x < 0 then -x else x
}

method absx(x:array<int>) returns (y:array<int>)
  ensures y.Length == x.Length
  ensures forall i :: 0 <= i < y.Length ==>  y[i] == abs(x[i])
{
  y := new int[x.Length];
  var j := 0;
  while (j < y.Length) {
    if (x[j] < 0) {
      y[j] := -x[j];
    } else {
      y[j] := x[j];
    }
    j := j + 1;
  }
}

method Main() {
  var d := new int[5];
  var c := new int[5];
  d[0], d[1], d[2], d[3], d[4] := -4, 1, 5, -2, -5;
  c := absx(d);
  print c[..];
}

The feedback from Dafny was that the file contains no code, as there was a parse error in the top-level module. I have corrected this issue by removing the invalid syntax and adding a valid code block.
