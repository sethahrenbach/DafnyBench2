  I apologize for the mistake in my previous response. Based on the Dafny feedback, it seems that the issue is with the syntax of the code. The error message suggests that the code is not well-formed and there is a parse error.

Here is the corrected code:

predicate InArray(a: array<int>, x: int)
    reads a
{
    exists i :: 0 <= i < a.Length && a[i] == x
}

method Intersection(a: array<int>, b: array<int>) returns (result: seq<int>)
    // All elements in the output are in both a and b
    ensures forall x :: x in result ==> (InArray(a, x) && InArray(b, x))
    // The elements in the output are all different
    ensures forall i, j :: 0 <= i < j < |result| ==> result[i] != result[j]
{
    var res: seq<int> := [];
    for i := 0 to a.Length
    {
        // Loop invariant: res contains all elements in a that are also in b
        // and all elements in b that are also in a
        // and all elements in a that are not in res
        // and all elements in b that are not in res
        assert InArray(a, a[i]) && InArray(b, a[i]) && a[i] !in res && b[i] !in res;

        if InArray(b, a[i]) && a[i] !in res
        {
            // Loop invariant: res contains all elements in a that are also in b
            // and all elements in b that are also in a
            // and all elements in a that are not in res
            // and all elements in b that are not in res
            assert InArray(a, a[i]) && InArray(b, a[i]) && a[i] !in res && b[i] !in res;

            res := res + [a[i]];

            // Loop invariant: res contains all elements in a that are also in b
            // and all elements in b that are also in a
            // and all elements in a that are not in res
            // and all elements in b that are not in res
            assert InArray(a, a[i]) && InArray(b, a[i]) && a[i] !in res && b[i] !in res;
        }
    }

    // Loop invariant: res contains all elements in a that are also in b
    // and all elements in b that are also in a
    // and all elements in a that are not in res
    // and all elements in b that are not in res
    assert InArray(a, a[i]) && InArray(b, a[i]) && a[i] !in res && b[i] !in res;

    result := res;

    // Loop invariant: res contains all elements in a that are also in b
    // and all elements in b that are also in a
    // and all elements in a that are not in res
    // and all elements in b that are not in res
    assert InArray(a, a[i]) && InArray(b, a[i]) && a[i] !in res && b[i] !in res;
}

I hope this corrected code passes the Dafny verification.
