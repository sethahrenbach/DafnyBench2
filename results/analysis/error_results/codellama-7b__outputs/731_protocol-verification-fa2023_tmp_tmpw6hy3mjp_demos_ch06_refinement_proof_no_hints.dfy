  I apologize for the mistake. Here is the corrected version of the program with the same preconditions and postconditions:

method foo(x: int) returns (y: int)
  ensures y == x + 1
{
  y := x + 1;
}

The error message you received was due to a missing semicolon at the end of the method body. I apologize for the mistake and I hope this corrected version passes the test.
