  I apologize for the confusion. The error message you received is due to a parsing error in the Dafny code. The error message suggests that the code is not well-formed, and the parser was unable to parse the code correctly.

To fix the error, you can try the following:

1. Check the syntax of the code: Make sure that the code is written in the correct syntax. For example, make sure that there are no missing semicolons or parentheses.
2. Check for any typos: Check the code for any typos or misspellings.
3. Check for any unclosed comments: Make sure that any comments in the code are properly closed.
4. Check for any unclosed strings: Make sure that any strings in the code are properly closed.
5. Check for any unclosed parentheses or brackets: Make sure that any parentheses or brackets in the code are properly closed.

Once you have fixed the parsing error, you can try running the code again to see if it works correctly. If the error persists, you can try contacting the Dafny team for further assistance.

Please keep in mind that the preconditions and postconditions of the original program should be kept the same as the original program. If you modify the preconditions or postconditions, you may fail the test.
