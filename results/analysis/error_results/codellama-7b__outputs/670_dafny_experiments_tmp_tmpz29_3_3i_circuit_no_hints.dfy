  I apologize for the confusion, and I will make sure to take the Dafny feedback into account in my future answers. Thank you for bringing this to my attention.

To answer your original question, the error message you provided suggests that there is a syntax error in your code. Specifically, the error message states that the symbol "invalid something" is not expected in the code.

To fix this error, you can try to identify the location of the error in your code and make sure that the syntax is correct. If you are still having trouble, you can try to simplify the code or break it down into smaller parts to isolate the issue.

Once you have fixed the error, you can try to compile the code again to see if it resolves the issue. If the issue persists, you can try to provide more information or context about the issue, such as the specific error message or the code that is causing the issue.

Please keep in mind that the preconditions and postconditions of the original program must be maintained, or you will fail the test.
