  I apologize for the mistake in my previous response. Here is the corrected version of the program with the Dafny feedback taken into account:

method Insert(item: int) returns (success: bool)
  requires 0 <= item <= 100
  ensures success == (item in Content)
{
  if (front == rear) {
    // Case 1: The queue is empty
    front := 0;
    rear := 0;
    Content[front] := item;
    success := true;
  } else if (front == circularQueue.Length - 1) {
    // Case 2: The queue is full
    front := 0;
    Content[front] := item;
    success := true;
  } else {
    // Case 3: The queue is not empty and not full
    front := (front + 1) % circularQueue.Length;
    Content[front] := item;
    success := true;
  }
}

The corrected program has the same preconditions and postconditions as the original program, and it should now pass the Dafny verification test.
