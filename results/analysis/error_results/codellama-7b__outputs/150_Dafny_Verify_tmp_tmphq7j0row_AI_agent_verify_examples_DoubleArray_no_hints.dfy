  I apologize for the mistake. Here is the corrected code:

method DoubleArray(src: array<int>, dst: array<int>)
    requires src.Length == dst.Length
    modifies dst
    ensures forall i :: 0 <= i < src.Length ==> dst[i] == 2 * old(src[i])
{
    var n := 0;
    while n < src.Length
    {
        dst[n] := 2 * src[n];
        n := n + 1;
    }
}

I removed the semicolon after the while loop, as it is not needed and can cause syntax errors. Additionally, I added a closing brace to the while loop to make the code valid.

I also added a closing brace to the method to make the code valid.

Please let me know if this corrected code works for you.
