  The error message you provided indicates that there are two errors in the Dafny program:

1. The first error is a "generic syntax error" at line 1, column 2. This error message is generated by the CoCo parser generator and indicates that the text being parsed is a badly malformed instance of a parser non-terminal.
2. The second error is a "file contains no code" warning at line 1, column 0. This error message indicates that the file contains no code, which can be because the file is empty, because some parse error left the top-level module with no well-formed declarations, or because a unclosed comment has commented-out the whole file.

To resolve these errors, you can try the following:

1. Check the syntax of the Dafny code to make sure it is correct and well-formed.
2. Make sure that the preconditions and postconditions are the same as the original program.
3. Try running the verifier with the `--no-termination` flag to disable the termination check and allow the verifier to verify the program without it.

Once you have made the necessary changes, you can try running the verifier again to see if it can verify the program correctly.
