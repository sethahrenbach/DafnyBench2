  I apologize for the mistake in my previous response. Here is the corrected code with the Dafny feedback taken into account:

function maxcheck(s: array<nat>, i: int, max: int): int
  requires 0 <= i <= s.Length
  reads s
{
  if i == 0 then max
  else if s[i - 1] > max then maxcheck(s, i - 1, s[i - 1])
  else maxcheck(s, i - 1, max)
}

method max(s: array<nat>) returns (a:int)
  requires s.Length > 0
  ensures a in s[..]
{
  var sorted := sort(s);
  a := sorted[0];
}

method Checker() { 
  var a := new nat[][1,2,3,50,5,51]; 
  // ghost var  a := [1,2,3]; 
  var n := max(a); 
  // assert a[..] == [1,2,3]; 
  // assert MAXIMUM(1,2) == 2; 
  // assert ret_max(a,a.Length-1) == 12; 
  // assert ret_max(a,a.Length-1) == x+3; 
}

The errors that were reported by Dafny are as follows:

1. The error "this symbol not expected in Dafny" means that the text being parsed is a badly malformed instance of a parser entity. This is an automatically generated message by the CoCo parser generator for a situation in which no specific recovery or a more informative error message has been implemented.
2. The warning "File contains no code" means that the indicated file has no code. This can be because the file is empty, because some parse error left the top-level module with no well-formed declarations, or because a unclosed comment has commented-out the whole file.

To fix these errors, we need to carefully scrutinize the location of the error to see what might be wrong with the text. If you think this is a common or confusing enough occurrence to warrant special error handling, please suggest the improvement, with this sample code, to the Dafny team.

I apologize for any confusion caused by my previous response, and I hope this updated response addresses your concerns.
