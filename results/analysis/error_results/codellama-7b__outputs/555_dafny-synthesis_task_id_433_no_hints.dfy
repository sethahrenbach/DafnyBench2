  I apologize for the confusion. It seems that the previous code had a syntax error. Here is the corrected code:

method IsGreater(n: int, a: array?<int>) returns (result: bool)
  requires a != null
  ensures result ==> forall i :: 0 <= i < a.Length ==> n > a[i]
  ensures !result ==> exists i :: 0 <= i < a.Length && n <= a[i]
{
  // Loop Invariant: n > a[i] for all i such that 0 <= i < a.Length
  // Base case: n > a[0]
  // Inductive step: if n > a[i] and i < a.Length-1, then n > a[i+1]
  result := true;
  var i := 0;
  while i < a.Length
  {
    // Assertion: n > a[i]
    assert n > a[i];
    if n <= a[i] {
      result := false;
      break;
    }
    i := i + 1;
  }
}

I hope this corrected code works for you. Let me know if you have any further questions or concerns.
