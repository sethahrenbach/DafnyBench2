  I apologize for the confusion. It seems that the error message you received is not related to the code you provided. The error message indicates that there is a parsing error in the code, specifically in the `invalid something` message.

To resolve this issue, you can try the following:

1. Check the code for any syntax errors or typos.
2. Make sure that the code is properly formatted and indented.
3. Check if there are any missing or unnecessary characters in the code.
4. If none of the above steps work, you can try running the code through a Dafny parser or compiler to see if it produces any more specific error messages.

Once you have resolved the parsing error, you can try running the code again to see if it passes the Dafny verification. If you continue to encounter issues, please let me know and I will do my best to assist you.
