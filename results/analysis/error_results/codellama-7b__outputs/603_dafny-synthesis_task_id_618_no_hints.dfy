  I apologize for the previous errors. Here is the corrected code with the Dafny feedback taken into account:

method ElementWiseDivide(a: seq<int>, b: seq<int>) returns (result: seq<int>)
    requires |a| == |b|
    requires forall i :: 0 <= i < |b| ==> b[i] != 0
    ensures |result| == |a|
    ensures forall i :: 0 <= i < |result| ==> result[i] == a[i] / b[i]
{
    var i := 0;
    while i < |a| {
        result := result + [a[i] / b[i]];
        i := i + 1;
    }
}

This code should now pass the Dafny verification. The errors in the previous code were due to the fact that the `while` loop was not well-formed, and the `i := i + 1` statement was not inside the loop body. The corrected code ensures that the `while` loop is well-formed by using the `ensures` clause to specify the postcondition, and that the `i := i + 1` statement is inside the loop body.
