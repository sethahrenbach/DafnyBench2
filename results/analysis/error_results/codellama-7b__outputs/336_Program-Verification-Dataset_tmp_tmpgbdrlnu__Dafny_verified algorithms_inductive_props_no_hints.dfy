  I apologize for the confusion. It seems that there was an issue with the syntax of the code. The error message suggests that the code is not well-formed, and that there is a problem with the parser.

To fix this issue, you can try to carefully review the code to ensure that it is properly formatted and that there are no syntax errors. You can also try to simplify the code to see if that helps to identify the problem.

If you are still having trouble, you can try to provide more information about the error message and the context in which it occurred. This can help to identify the specific issue and provide more targeted advice on how to fix it.

Please keep in mind that the preconditions and postconditions of the program must be the same as the original program, or you will fail the test.
