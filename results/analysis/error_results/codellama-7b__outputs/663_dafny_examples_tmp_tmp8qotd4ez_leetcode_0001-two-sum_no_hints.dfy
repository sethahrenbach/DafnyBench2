  I apologize for the confusion. It seems that the error message is indicating that the code is not well-formed and the parser is unable to recover from it.

In this case, the error message is suggesting that the issue is likely with the `p_generic_syntax_error` non-terminal, which is used to represent a generic syntax error.

To resolve this issue, you can try to carefully examine the code and see if there is anything that could be causing the error. If you are unable to find the issue, you can try to simplify the code or break it down into smaller parts to see if the error persists.

Alternatively, you can try to provide more context or information about the code you are trying to verify, such as the purpose of the code or any constraints or assumptions that are being made. This may help the Dafny team to better understand the issue and provide more specific guidance on how to resolve it.

Please keep the preconditions and postconditions the same as the original program, or you fail the test.
