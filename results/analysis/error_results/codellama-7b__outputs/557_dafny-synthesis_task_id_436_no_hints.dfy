  I apologize for the confusion. It seems that there was an error in the previous answer. Here is the corrected version:

method FindNegativeNumbers(arr: array<int>) returns (negativeList: seq<int>)
    // All numbers in the output are negative and exist in the input
    ensures forall i :: 0 <= i < |negativeList| ==> IsNegative(negativeList[i]) && negativeList[i] in arr[..]
    // All negative numbers in the input are in the output
    ensures forall i :: 0 <= i < arr.Length && IsNegative(arr[i]) ==> arr[i] in negativeList
{
    // Loop invariant: negativeList is a sequence of negative numbers that are all in the input array
    loop invariant forall i :: 0 <= i < |negativeList| ==> IsNegative(negativeList[i]) && negativeList[i] in arr[..]
    // Assertion: negativeList is a subset of arr
    assert negativeList in arr[..]

    negativeList := [];
    for i := 0 to arr.Length
    {
        // Assertion: arr[i] is a number
        assert arr[i] in int
        // Assertion: arr[i] is not negative
        assert !IsNegative(arr[i])

        if IsNegative(arr[i])
        {
            // Assertion: negativeList is a sequence of numbers
            assert negativeList in seq<int>
            // Assertion: negativeList is a sequence of numbers that are all in the input array
            assert negativeList in arr[..]
            // Assertion: negativeList is a sequence of negative numbers
            assert forall i :: 0 <= i < |negativeList| ==> IsNegative(negativeList[i])
            // Assertion: negativeList is a sequence of negative numbers that are all in the input array
            assert forall i :: 0 <= i < |negativeList| ==> negativeList[i] in arr[..]

            negativeList := negativeList + [arr[i]];
        }
    }
}
