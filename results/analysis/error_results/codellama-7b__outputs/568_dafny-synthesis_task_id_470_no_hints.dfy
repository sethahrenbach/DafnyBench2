  I apologize for the previous errors. Here is the corrected code:

method PairwiseAddition(a: array<int>) returns (result: array<int>)
    requires a != null
    requires a.Length % 2 == 0
    ensures result != null
    ensures result.Length == a.Length / 2
    ensures forall i :: 0 <= i < result.Length ==> result[i] == a[2*i] + a[2*i + 1]
{
    result := new int[a.Length / 2];
    var i := 0;
    while i < a.Length / 2
    {
        result[i] := a[2*i] + a[2*i + 1];
        i := i + 1;
    }
}

The error was due to the fact that the `a` and `result` variables were not declared as arrays, so the `a.Length` and `result.Length` expressions were not valid. By adding the `<int>` type annotation, we make the variables arrays, and the expressions are now valid.

Also, the `result` variable was not initialized, so the postcondition was not satisfied. By adding the initialization of the `result` array, we ensure that the postcondition is satisfied.

I apologize for any confusion caused by the previous errors.
