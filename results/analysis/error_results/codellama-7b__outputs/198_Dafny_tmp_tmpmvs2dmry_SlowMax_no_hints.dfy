  I apologize for the confusion. It seems that the error message is indicating that there is a problem with the syntax of the code.

The error message is suggesting that there is a problem with the `something` in the `invalid something` message. This suggests that there is a typo or a mistake in the code.

To fix the error, you can try to carefully review the code and make sure that there are no typos or mistakes. You can also try to simplify the code and see if that helps to resolve the issue.

If you are still having trouble, you can try to provide more information about the code and the error message, such as the line number and the exact error message. This can help the Dafny team to better understand the issue and provide a more accurate solution.

Please keep the preconditions and postconditions the same as the original program, or you fail the test.
