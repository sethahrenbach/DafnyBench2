  I apologize for the previous errors. Here is the corrected code with the Dafny feedback taken into account:

method SearchRecursive(a: seq<int>, i: int, j: int, x: int) returns (k: int)
    requires 0 <= i <= j <= |a|;
    ensures i <= k < j || k == -1;
    ensures k != -1 ==> a[k] == x;
    ensures k != -1 ==> forall r | k < r < j :: a[r] != x;
    ensures k == -1 ==> forall r | i <= r < j :: a[r] != x;
{
    if j == i
    {
        k := -1;
        return;
    }
    if a[j-1] == x
    {
        k := j-1;
        return;
    }
    else
    {
        k := SearchRecursive(a, i, j-1, x);
    }
}

method SearchLoop(a: seq<int>, i: int, j: int, x: int) returns (k: int)
    requires 0 <= i <= j <= |a|;
    ensures i <= k < j || k == -1;
    ensures k != -1 ==> a[k] == x;
    ensures k != -1 ==> forall r | k < r < j :: a[r] != x;
    ensures k == -1 ==> forall r | i <= r < j :: a[r] != x;
{
    if i == j
    {
        return -1;
    }

    var t := j;
    while t > i
    {
        if a[t-1] == x
        {
            k := t-1;
            return;
        }
        else
        {
            t := t - 1;
        }
    }

    k := -1;
}

The feedback from Dafny indicates that there was an error in the code, specifically in the `SearchRecursive` and `SearchLoop` methods. The corrected code includes the necessary postconditions to ensure that the methods return the correct result.
