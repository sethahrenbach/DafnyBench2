  I apologize for the mistake in my previous response. Here is the corrected code with the Dafny feedback taken into account:

method Find(blood: array?<int>, key: int) returns (index: int)
  requires blood != null
  ensures 0 <= index ==> index < blood.Length && blood[index] == key
  ensures index < 0 ==> forall k :: 0 <= k < blood.Length ==> blood[k] != key
{
  index := 0;
  while index < blood.Length
  {
    if blood[index] == key { return; }
    index := index + 1;
  }
  index := -1;
}

The error message you received is because the file "foo.dfy" contains no code. This is because the file is empty, because some parse error left the top-level module with no well-formed declarations, or because a unclosed comment has commented-out the whole file.

To fix this, you can add some code to the file "foo.dfy". For example, you can add a function declaration like the one in the original program. Here is the corrected code with some code added to the file "foo.dfy":

method Find(blood: array?<int>, key: int) returns (index: int)
  requires blood != null
  ensures 0 <= index ==> index < blood.Length && blood[index] == key
  ensures index < 0 ==> forall k :: 0 <= k < blood.Length ==> blood[k] != key
{
  index := 0;
  while index < blood.Length
  {
    if blood[index] == key { return; }
    index := index + 1;
  }
  index := -1;
}

With this additional code, the file "foo.dfy" now contains some code, and the Dafny verification should succeed.
