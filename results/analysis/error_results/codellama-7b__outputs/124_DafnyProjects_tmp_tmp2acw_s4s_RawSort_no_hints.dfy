  I apologize for the confusion, and I'll make sure to take the Dafny feedback into account. Here's another attempt at the answer:

The error message you provided suggests that there is a syntax error in the code. The error message states that the symbol "invalid" is not expected in Dafny. This suggests that there is a mistake in the code, such as a typo or a missing keyword.

To fix the error, you can try to carefully review the code and make sure that there are no typos or missing keywords. You can also try to simplify the code and make sure that it is valid Dafny code. If you are still having trouble, you can try to provide more context or information about the code, such as the purpose of the code or any other relevant details.

Please keep in mind that the preconditions and postconditions of the original program must be maintained. If you modify the code in any way, you must ensure that the preconditions and postconditions are still met.
