  I apologize for the mistake in my previous response. It seems that the Dafny verifier is reporting an error in the code. Here is a revised version of the code that should pass the Dafny verification:

module Test

function TestMap(a: map<int, (int,int)>)
  ensures TestMap(a) == (map k | k in a :: a[k].0, a[k].1)

function TestSet0(a: set<int>)
  ensures TestSet0(a) == (set k | k in a && k < 7)

function TestSet1(a: set<int>, m: int)
  ensures TestSet1(a, m) == (set k | k in a && k < 7 :: m + (k - m))

function TestSet2(a: set<int>, m: int)
  requires m in a && m < 7
  ensures TestSet2(a, m) == (set k | k in a :: if k < 7 then k else m)

endmodule

I hope this revised version of the code passes the Dafny verification. If you have any further questions or concerns, please let me know.
