  I apologize for the confusion. It seems that the Dafny verifier is unable to parse the code due to a syntax error.

The error message suggests that the issue is with the `invalid something` message, which is typically the name of an internal parser non-terminal. This message is generated by the CoCo parser generator for a situation in which no specific recovery or a more informative error message has been implemented.

To resolve this issue, you can try the following:

1. Carefully scrutinize the location of the error to see what might be wrong with the text.
2. If you think this is a common or confusing enough occurrence to warrant special error handling, please suggest the improvement, with this sample code, to the Dafny team.

Alternatively, you can try to modify the code to make it more readable and error-free. For example, you can use more descriptive variable names, and make sure that the code is properly indented and formatted.

Once you have made the necessary changes, you can try running the Dafny verifier again to see if it can successfully parse the code.
