  I apologize for the confusion. Here is the corrected answer:

The error message you provided indicates that there is a syntax error in the code. Specifically, the error message states that the text being parsed is a badly malformed instance of a parser non-terminal. This suggests that there is a problem with the way the code is structured or the way it is written.

To resolve this issue, you should carefully scrutinize the location of the error to see what might be wrong with the code. If you think this is a common or confusing enough occurrence to warrant special error handling, please suggest the improvement, with this sample code, to the Dafny team.

In the meantime, you can try to fix the syntax error by checking the code for any typos or other mistakes. If you are still having trouble, you can try to simplify the code or break it down into smaller, more manageable pieces to see if you can identify the source of the problem.

I hope this helps. Let me know if you have any further questions or concerns.
