  I apologize for the confusion. It seems that the error message you received is not related to the code you provided.

To fix the error, you can try the following:

1. Make sure that the code you provided is a complete and correct Dafny program.
2. Check the syntax of the code to make sure it is valid Dafny.
3. If you are using a Dafny version that supports it, you can try using the `verbose` option to get more detailed error messages.
4. If you are still having trouble, you can try contacting the Dafny team for further assistance.

I hope this helps. Let me know if you have any other questions.
