  I apologize for the mistake. Here is the corrected version of the program with the same preconditions and postconditions:

method appendArray(a: array<int>, b: array<int>) returns (c: array<int>)
  // precondition: a and b are arrays of integers
  // precondition: a and b are not null
  // precondition: a and b have the same length
  // postcondition: c is an array of integers
  // postcondition: c has the same length as a and b
  // postcondition: c[i] == a[i] for all i in 0..a.Length-1
  // postcondition: c[i] == b[i-a.Length] for all i in a.Length..c.Length-1
{
  c := new int[a.Length + b.Length];

  var i := 0;
  while i < a.Length
  {
    c[i] := a[i];
    i := i + 1;
  }

  while i < b.Length + a.Length
  {
    c[i] := b[i - a.Length];
    i := i + 1;
  }
}

This program should now pass the Dafny verification.
