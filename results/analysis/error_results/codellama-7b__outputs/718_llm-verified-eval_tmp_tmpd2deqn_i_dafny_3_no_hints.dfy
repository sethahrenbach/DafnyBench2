  I apologize for the mistake in my previous answer. Here is the corrected version of the program:

function sum(s: seq<int>, n: nat): int
    requires n <= |s|
    ensures n == 0 || sum(s, n-1) == s[0] + sum(s[1..], n-1)
{
    if |s| == 0 || n == 0 then
        0
    else
        s[0] + sum(s[1..], n-1)
}

lemma sum_plus(s: seq<int>, i: nat)
    requires i < |s|
    ensures sum(s, i) + s[i] == sum(s, i+1)
{
}

method below_zero(ops: seq<int>) returns (result: bool)
    ensures result <==> exists n: nat :: n <= |ops| && sum(ops, n) < 0
{
    result := false;
    var t := 0;
    for i := 0 to |ops|
    {
        t := t + ops[i];
        sum_plus(ops, i);
        if t < 0 {
            result := true;
            return;
        }
    }
}

I have fixed the error by adding the `sum_plus` lemma, which ensures that the sum of the first `i` elements of the sequence is equal to the sum of the first `i+1` elements of the sequence. This lemma is needed to prove the correctness of the `below_zero` method.
