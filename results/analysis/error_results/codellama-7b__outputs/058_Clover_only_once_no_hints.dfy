  I apologize for the confusion. It seems that the previous answer did not address the issue. Here is another attempt at the solution:

method only_once<T>(a: array<T>, key: T) returns (b: bool)
  ensures (multiset(a[..])[key] == 1) <==> b
{
  var i := 0;
  b := false;
  var keyCount := 0;
  loop invariant i <= a.Length;
  loop invariant (multiset(a[..])[key] == keyCount) ==> b;
  loop variant a.Length - i;
  while i < a.Length
  {
    if (a[i] == key)
    {
      keyCount := keyCount + 1;
    }
    if (keyCount == 1)
    {
      b := true;
    }
    else
    {
      b := false;
    }
    i := i + 1;
  }
}

This solution should work correctly, as it uses the `multiset` function to count the number of occurrences of `key` in the array `a`, and then checks if this count is equal to 1. If the count is 1, then `b` is set to `true`, otherwise it is set to `false`.

I hope this solution works for you. If you have any further questions or concerns, please let me know.
