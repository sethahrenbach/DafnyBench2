  I apologize for the mistake. Here is the corrected program:

method foo(x: int) returns (y: int)
  requires x > 0
  ensures y > 0
{
  y := x + 1;
}

I have also included the preconditions and postconditions from the original program.

Please let me know if this corrected program passes the verification.
