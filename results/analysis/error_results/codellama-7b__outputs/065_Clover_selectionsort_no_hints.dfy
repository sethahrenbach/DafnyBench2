  I apologize for the mistake in my previous answer. Here is the corrected code with the Dafny feedback taken into account:

method SelectionSort(a: array<int>)
  modifies a
  ensures forall i,j :: 0 <= i < j < a.Length ==> a[i] <= a[j]
  ensures multiset(a[..]) == old(multiset(a[..]))
{
  var n:= 0;
  while n != a.Length
  {
    var mindex, m := n, n+1;
    while m != a.Length
    {
      // Loop Invariant: a[0..n] is sorted
      // Loop Invariant: a[n+1..m] is sorted
      // Loop Invariant: a[m+1..a.Length] is sorted
      assert a[0..n] == sorted(a[0..n]);
      assert a[n+1..m] == sorted(a[n+1..m]);
      assert a[m+1..a.Length] == sorted(a[m+1..a.Length]);
      if a[m] < a[mindex] {
        mindex := m;
      }
      m := m+1;
    }
    a[n], a[mindex] := a[mindex], a[n];
    n := n+1;
  }
}

The error message you received was due to the fact that the `sorted` function is not defined in the current scope. You need to define the `sorted` function before you can use it in the loop invariants.

Here is an example of how you can define the `sorted` function:

function sorted(a: array<int>): bool
{
  var i := 0;
  while i < a.Length-1
  {
    if a[i] > a[i+1] {
      return false;
    }
    i := i+1;
  }
  return true;
}

Once you have defined the `sorted` function, you can use it in the loop invariants as shown in the corrected code.

I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any further questions.
