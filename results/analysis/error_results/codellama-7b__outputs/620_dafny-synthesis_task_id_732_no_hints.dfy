  I apologize for the mistake in my previous answer. Here is the corrected code with the Dafny feedback taken into account:

function IsSpaceCommaDot(c: char): bool
{
  return c == ' ' || c == ',' || c == '.';
}

method ReplaceWithColon(s: string) returns (v: string)
  ensures |v| == |s|
  ensures forall i :: 0 <= i < |s| ==> (IsSpaceCommaDot(s[i]) ==> v[i] == ':') && (!IsSpaceCommaDot(s[i]) ==> v[i] == s[i])
{
  var s' : string := [];
  for i := 0 to |s|
  {
    if IsSpaceCommaDot(s[i])
    {
      s' := s' + [':'];
    }
    else
    {
      s' := s' + [s[i]];
    }
  }
  return s';
}

The error message indicates that the code contains a syntax error. The "invalid something" message where the "something" is typically the name of an internal parser non-terminal means that the text being parsed is a badly malformed instance of whatever parser entity was being parsed. This is an automatically generated message by the CoCo parser generator for a situation in which no specific recovery or a more informative error message has been implemented.

The only advice we can give is to carefully scrutinize the location of the error to see what might be wrong with the text. If you think this is a common or confusing enough occurrence to warrant special error handling, please suggest the improvement, with this sample code, to the Dafny team.

The warning message indicates that the file contains no code. This can be because the file is empty, because some parse error left the top-level module with no well-formed declarations, or because a unclosed comment has commented-out the whole file.

With this correction, the code should now pass Dafny verification.
