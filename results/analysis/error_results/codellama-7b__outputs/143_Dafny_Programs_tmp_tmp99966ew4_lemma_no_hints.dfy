  I apologize for the mistake in my previous response. Here is the corrected version of the Dafny program:

method FindZero(a: array<int>) returns (index: int)
   requires a != null
   requires forall i :: 0 <= i < a.Length ==> 0 <= a[i]
   requires forall i :: 0 < i < a.Length ==> a[i-1]-1 <= a[i]
   ensures index < 0  ==> forall i :: 0 <= i < a.Length ==> a[i] != 0
   ensures 0 <= index ==> index < a.Length && a[index] == 0
{
   index := 0;
   while index < a.Length
   {
      if a[index] == 0 { return; }
      index := index + 1;
   }
   index := -1;
}

I have corrected the syntax error in the `FindZero` method by removing the `SkippingLemma` method, which was not defined in the original program.

Please note that the `SkippingLemma` method is not defined in the original program, and it is not clear what the purpose of this method is. Therefore, I have left it out of the corrected program. If you need to include this method in your solution, please let me know and I will be happy to help you with its definition.
