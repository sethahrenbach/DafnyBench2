  I apologize for the confusion, and I'll make sure to follow the instructions correctly. Here's my revised answer:

The error message you received is indicating that the text being parsed is a badly malformed instance of the parser entity being used. This is an automatically generated message by the CoCo parser generator for a situation in which no specific recovery or a more informative error message has been implemented.

To resolve this issue, you can try the following:

1. Carefully scrutinize the location of the error to see what might be wrong with the text.
2. If you think this is a common or confusing enough occurrence to warrant special error handling, please suggest the improvement, with this sample code, to the Dafny team.

I hope this helps. Let me know if you have any further questions.
