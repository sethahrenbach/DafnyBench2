  I apologize for the mistake. Here is the corrected version of the program with the same preconditions and postconditions:

method swap<T>(a: array<T>, i: int, j: int)
  requires a != null
  requires 0 <= i < a.Length && 0 <= j < a.Length
  modifies a
  ensures a[i] == old(a[j])
  ensures a[j] == old(a[i])
  ensures forall m :: 0 <= m < a.Length && m != i && m != j ==> a[m] == old(a[m])
  ensures multiset(a[..]) == old(multiset(a[..]))
{
  var t := a[i];
  a[i] := a[j];
  a[j] := t;
}

This program correctly swaps the elements at indices i and j in the array a. The preconditions ensure that the indices are valid and the array is not null, and the postconditions ensure that the elements at indices i and j have been swapped, and that the array has not been modified in any other way.
