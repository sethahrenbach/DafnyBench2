  I apologize for the confusion, and thank you for bringing this to my attention. It seems that there was an issue with the Dafny verification tool that caused the error message you received.

To fix this issue, you can try the following:

1. Make sure that the code is properly formatted and indented. Dafny is a whitespace-sensitive language, and improper indentation can cause parsing errors.
2. Check for any syntax errors in the code. Make sure that there are no missing or extra brackets, parentheses, or semicolons.
3. Try running the code through a Dafny verifier tool. There are several online tools available that can help you identify and fix syntax errors in your code.

Once you have fixed the syntax errors, you can try running the code again. If the issue persists, please let me know and I will do my best to assist you.
