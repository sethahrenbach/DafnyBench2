  I apologize for the confusion. Here is the corrected code:

method MaxLengthList(lists: seq<seq<int>>) returns (maxList: seq<int>)
    requires |lists| > 0
    ensures forall l :: l in lists ==> |l| <= |maxList|
    ensures maxList in lists
{
    maxList := lists[0];

    for i := 1 to |lists|
    {
        if |lists[i]| > |maxList| {
            maxList := lists[i];
        }
    }

    // Postcondition 1: maxList is in lists
    assert maxList in lists;

    // Postcondition 2: maxList is the longest list in lists
    assert forall l :: l in lists ==> |l| <= |maxList|;
}
