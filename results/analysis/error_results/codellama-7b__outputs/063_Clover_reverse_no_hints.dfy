  I apologize for the confusion. It seems that the previous code I provided was not valid Dafny code. Here is a corrected version of the code that should pass the Dafny verification:

method reverse(a: array<int>)
  modifies a
  ensures forall i :: 0 <= i < a.Length ==> a[i] == old(a[a.Length - 1 - i])
{
  var i := 0;
  while i < a.Length / 2
  {
    a[i], a[a.Length - 1 - i] := a[a.Length - 1 - i], a[i];
    i := i + 1;
  }
}

This code should now pass the Dafny verification. I apologize for any inconvenience caused by the previous errors.
