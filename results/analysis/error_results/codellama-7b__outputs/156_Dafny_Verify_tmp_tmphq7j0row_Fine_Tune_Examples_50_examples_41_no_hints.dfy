  I apologize for the confusion. It seems that the previous response did not address the issue. Here is another attempt at the answer:

The error message you are seeing is likely due to a syntax error in your code. The error message indicates that the parser was expecting a different symbol, but instead found an invalid symbol.

To fix this error, you will need to review your code and make sure that it is properly formatted and contains no syntax errors. You can try running the code through a linter or syntax checker to help identify any issues.

If you are still having trouble, you can try breaking your code into smaller functions or modules to help identify the source of the error. You can also try commenting out sections of your code to see if the error goes away.

Once you have identified the source of the error, you can try to fix it by correcting any syntax errors or improving the structure of your code. If you are still having trouble, you can try reaching out to the Dafny team for further assistance.
