  I apologize for the confusion. It seems that there was an error in the Dafny verification process. Here is the corrected version of the program:

method search(s: seq<int>, x: int): int
  requires 0 <= x < s.Length
  ensures 0 <= result <= s.Length
  ensures result == s.IndexOf(x)
{
  var i := 0;
  while i < s.Length && s[i] != x {
    i := i + 1;
  }
  return i;
}

I hope this corrected version passes the test.

If you have any further questions or concerns, please let me know.
