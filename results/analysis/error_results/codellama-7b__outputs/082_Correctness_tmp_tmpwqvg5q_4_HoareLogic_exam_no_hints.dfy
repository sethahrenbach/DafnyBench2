  I apologize for the mistake in my previous response. Here is the corrected answer:

b'foo.dfy(1,2): Error: this symbol not expected in Dafny (ID: p_generic_syntax_error)\nThis "invalid something" message where the something is typically\nthe name of an internal parser non-terminal means that the text being parsed\nis a badly malformed instance of whatever parser entity was being parsed.\nThis is an automatically generated message by the CoCo parser generator\nfor a situation in which no specific recovery or a\nmore informative error message has been implemented.\n\nThe only advice we can give is to carefully scrutinize the location of the\nerror to see what might be wrong with the text. If you think this is a\ncommon or confusing enough occurrence to warrant special error handling,\nplease suggest the improvement, with this sample code, to the Dafny team.\foo.dfy(1,0): Warning: File contains no code (ID: p_file_has_no_code)\nThe indicated file has no code. This can be because the file is empty, because some parse error\nleft the top-level module with no well-formed declarations, or because a unclosed comment\nhas commented-out the whole file.\n1 parse errors detected in foo.dfy\n'

Please try again by taking the Dafny feedback.
Please keep the preconditions and postconditions the same as the original program, or you fail the test.
