/*
The error messages indicate that:

1. The argument to 'old' at line 4 does not dereference the mutable heap, so 'old' has no effect. However, since the preconditions and postconditions need to remain the same as the original program, we cannot modify this line.

2. The loop invariants at lines 18 and 19 could not be proved to be maintained by the loop.

After further analysis, it seems that the issue lies with the use of the ghost variable nums_before. In the previous attempt, I removed nums_before and modified the invariants to use old(nums[..i]) and old(nums[j]) instead. However, it appears that this approach does not work either.

The reason is that old(nums[..i]) and old(nums[j]) refer to the state of the array at the beginning of the method, not at the beginning of each loop iteration. Therefore, the invariants using these expressions do not capture the intended properties.

To address this issue, we need to find a way to express the invariants without relying on the old state of the array. One approach is to focus on the properties that are maintained by the loop itself, rather than trying to relate the current state to the initial state.

Here's a modified version of the method with adjusted invariants:

method RemoveDuplicates(nums: array<int>) returns (num_length: int)
  modifies nums
  requires forall i, j | 0 <= i < j < nums.Length :: nums[i] <= nums[j]
  ensures nums.Length == old(nums).Length
  ensures 0 <= num_length <= nums.Length
  ensures forall i, j | 0 <= i < j < num_length :: nums[i] != nums[j]
  ensures forall i | 0 <= i < num_length :: nums[i] in old(nums[..])
  ensures forall i | 0 <= i < nums.Length :: old(nums[i]) in nums[..num_length]
{
  if nums.Length <= 1 {
    return nums.Length;
  }
  var last := 0;
  var i := 1;
  while i < nums.Length
    invariant 0 <= last < i <= nums.Length
    invariant forall j, k | 0 <= j < k <= last :: nums[j] < nums[k]
    invariant forall j | 0 <= j < i :: nums[j] <= nums[last]
  {
    if nums[last] < nums[i] {
      last := last + 1;
      nums[last] := nums[i];
    }
    i := i + 1;
  }
  return last + 1;
}

/*
The modified invariants are:

1. last is always strictly less than i, and both are within the bounds of the array.
2. The elements in nums[..last+1] are strictly increasing.
3. All elements in nums[..i] are less than or equal to nums[last].

These invariants capture the properties maintained by the loop itself, without referring to the initial state of the array. They should be sufficient to prove the correctness of the method, along with the preconditions and postconditions.

Note that the preconditions and postconditions are kept the same as the original program to avoid failing the test, even though the 'old' argument at line 4 has no effect.
