/*
I apologize for the confusion in my previous responses. It seems that the invariant relating lmax to the peekSum function is not sufficient on its own.

We need to split the cases based on whether i-1 is a peek index or not, and specify the relationship between sum, lmax, and peekSum accordingly:

  invariant isPeek(v, i-1) ==> lmax == v[i-1] && sum == peekSum(v, i-1) + v[i-1]
  invariant !isPeek(v, i-1) ==> lmax >= v[i-1] && sum == peekSum(v, i-1)

The first invariant states that if i-1 is a peek index, then lmax is equal to v[i-1] and sum is equal to peekSum(v, i-1) + v[i-1], which is effectively peekSum(v, i).

The second invariant states that if i-1 is not a peek index, then lmax is greater than or equal to v[i-1] and sum is equal to peekSum(v, i-1), which is the same as peekSum(v, i) in this case.

These invariants, combined with the invariant:
  invariant forall k :: 0 <= k < i ==> lmax >= v[k]
which ensures that lmax is greater than or equal to all elements in v[0..i), should provide enough information for Dafny to prove the correctness of the loop and the method.

I apologize for the confusion in my previous responses. If this still doesn't work or if you have any further questions, please let me know.
