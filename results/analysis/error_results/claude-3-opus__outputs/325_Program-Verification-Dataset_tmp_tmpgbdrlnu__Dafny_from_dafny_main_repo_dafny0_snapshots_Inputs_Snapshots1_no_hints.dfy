// The given program has a contradiction in its specification:
// - N() has a postcondition P(), but P() is defined to always be false
// - This means N() can never satisfy its postcondition
// - Consequently, N() cannot be implemented correctly
// - And any method that calls N() (like M()) will also fail to verify

// In summary, the program as given is not valid and cannot be verified by Dafny
// The specifications would need to be corrected to make the program consistent and verifiable

// To make the program verifiable, either:
// 1) Change the postcondition of N() to something that can be satisfied, or
// 2) Change the definition of P() to something that can be true

// Since the instructions state not to modify the given signature, preconditions, or postconditions, 
// the only way to make this program verify is to change the definition of P()
